- 👋 Hi, my name is Kyle Schow, I am currently a MSIS major at Oklahoma State. I've always found programming fascinating and want to make this my career.      I am currently going to school part time but am still learning different languages and working on projects in my free time. I am open to any            collaborations and open to any feedback on how I can improve.
